        <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
        <p>In 1984, Karmarkar introduced an algorithm for linear programming, which was a major advancement over the previously known simplex algorithm. This algorithm, now known as Karmarkar's algorithm, runs in polynomial time, making it exponentially faster for certain types of problems. His work was widely recognized and was a key factor in the development of practical solutions for large-scale optimization problems in fields like economics, engineering, and computer science.</p>

        <h2>Impact on Optimization</h2>
        <p>Karmarkar's algorithm brought new insight into the complexity of optimization problems. Before his work, many optimization problems were considered too complex for efficient computational methods. Karmarkarâ€™s algorithm demonstrated that these problems could be solved in polynomial time, significantly improving computational efficiency and making optimization problems more feasible to solve on modern computers.</p>
